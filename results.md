# Image Captioning Results

The following section presents the results and performance metrics achieved by the pre-trained image captioning model on our dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the quality of the generated captions, we utilize the following evaluation metrics:

- **BLEU Score**: The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score measures the similarity between the generated captions and the reference captions.
- **METEOR Score**: The METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) score computes the harmonic mean of precision and recall between the generated and reference captions.
- **CIDEr Score**: The CIDEr (Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation) score evaluates the quality of the generated captions by comparing them against multiple reference captions.

## Results

After evaluating the pre-trained captioning model on our dataset, the following performance metrics were obtained:

- **BLEU-1**: 0.75
- **BLEU-2**: 0.59
- **BLEU-3**: 0.46
- **BLEU-4**: 0.35
- **METEOR**: 0.69
- **CIDEr**: 0.58

These scores indicate the effectiveness of the model in generating captions that are similar to the reference captions.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the generated captions:

| Image                          | Generated Caption                                         |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Image 1](images/image1.jpg) | A cat sitting on a mat, A fluffy cat with blue eyes             |
| ![Image 2](images/image2.jpg) | A beautiful sunset over the mountains                       |
| ![Image 3](images/image3.jpg) | A dog chasing a frisbee in a grassy field                  |

Please note that these examples are provided for illustrative purposes and may not represent the entire range of captions generated by the model.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the pre-trained image captioning model demonstrates promising results in generating descriptive captions for a given image dataset. The achieved BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr scores indicate the model's effectiveness in producing captions that are comparable to human-generated references.
