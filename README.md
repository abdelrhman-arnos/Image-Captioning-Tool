## Introduction

Image captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions for images. This project focuses on utilizing a pre-trained captioning model to generate captions for a given image dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure that your image dataset and caption dataset are prepared as described in the Dataset section.

2. Modify the pretrained_captioning_model.py script with the appropriate paths and configurations for your pre-trained model.

3. Run the pretrained_captioning_model.py script to generate captions for your images:
    ```
    python pretrained_captioning_model.py
    ```
    The generated captions will be displayed in the console output.

## Dataset
The image dataset and caption dataset used for training the captioning model should be prepared as follows:

Image Dataset: Place your collection of images inside the images directory. Ensure the images are in a suitable format (e.g., JPG or PNG).

Caption Dataset: Create a file named captions.txt that contains the captions corresponding to each image in your dataset. Each line should follow the format: image_filename\tcaption1, caption2, ....

## Model Training
If you wish to train your own captioning model, refer to the [Model Training](/model_training.md) guide for detailed instructions.

## Results
The results and performance metrics achieved by the pre-trained model on our dataset can be found in the [Results](/results.md) document.
