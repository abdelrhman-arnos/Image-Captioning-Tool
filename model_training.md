# Model Training

This document provides a guide on how to train your own image captioning model using the provided datasets and scripts.

## Dataset Preparation

Before training the image captioning model, you need to prepare the image dataset and the corresponding caption dataset.

1. **Image Dataset**: Place your collection of images inside the `images` directory. Ensure the images are in a suitable format (e.g., JPEG or PNG).

2. **Caption Dataset**: Create a file named `captions.txt` that contains the captions corresponding to each image in your dataset. Each line should follow the format: `image_filename\tcaption1, caption2, ...`.

## Model Configuration

To configure the model training process, you can modify the parameters in the `config.py` file. Adjust the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs, to suit your specific requirements.

## Training Procedure

1. Run the `train.py` script to start the model training process:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
    This will initiate the training process using the configured parameters and the provided image and caption datasets.

2. During training, the model will iteratively update its parameters to learn the associations between images and captions. The training progress will be displayed in the console output.

3. Once the training process is completed, the trained model will be saved to the specified output directory.

## Fine-Tuning
If you wish to further improve the model's performance, you can perform fine-tuning on the pre-trained model. Follow these steps:

1. Load the pre-trained model weights using the `load_model` function in the `train.py` script.

2. Adjust the fine-tuning parameters, such as the learning rate, number of fine-tuning epochs, and the layers to be fine-tuned, in the `config.py` file.

3. Run the `train.py` script again to start the fine-tuning process.

## Evaluation and Testing
After training or fine-tuning the model, you can evaluate its performance and test it on new images. Use the `evaluate.py` script and the `test.py` script respectively. Modify these scripts as needed to suit your specific evaluation and testing requirements.

## Conclusion
Training your own image captioning model provides the opportunity to customize and improve the caption generation process. Experiment with different configurations, datasets, and fine-tuning techniques to achieve the desired results.
